# Description

Imagine an ecosystem capable of editing and converting images quickly and efficiently, allowing users to process multiple files in seconds. 
<b> This is the main objective of this project. </b>

The <i> Bulk Image Editor </i> and <i> Bulk Image Converter </i> applications offer a practical and affordable alternative to the paid photo editing programmes that predominate on the internet, combining simplicity, speed, and efficiency in a single integrated system.


# Bulk Image Converter

This is a simple software that allows you to convert images in the most common formats: JPG, PNG, TIFF, and RAW.

You can convert multiple photos from a folder at once.


1. Select a folder from your computer;
2. Select the desired format;
3. Done! All photos in a folder are converted to the desired format!



# Bulk Image Editor

With regard to the ecosystem, this software, similar to the previous one, allows you to convert settings such as brightness and contrast for all photos in a folder.

1. Select a photo from your computer;
2. Select the brightness and contrast desired;
4. Click the button to save the changes applied to the photo;
5. Select the folder you want to edit the photos;
4. Done! All photos in a folder are edited to the desired brightness and contrast!
